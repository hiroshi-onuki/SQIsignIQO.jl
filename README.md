# SQIsign using IdealToIsogenyIQO

A proof-of-concept implementation of
SQIsign using IdealToIsogenyIQO
proposed in [Ideal-to-isogeny algorithm using 2-dimensional isogenies and its application to SQIsign](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/778)
using [Julia](https://julialang.org)
and [Nemo](https://www.nemocas.org).

## Usage

You can run benchmark for SQIsign at the NIST security levels 1, 3, and 5 by
